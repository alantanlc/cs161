    "\n",
    "Last class we introduced recurrence relations, such as T(n) = 2T(floor(n/2)) + n. Typically these reflect the runtime of recursive algorithms. For example, the recurrence above would correspond to an algorithm that made two recursive calls on subproblems of size floor(n/2), and then did n units of additional work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will be learning about how to solve these recurrences to get bounds on the runtime (like T(n) = O(n log n))."

    "__Recurrence:__ T(1) = 1 and T(n) = 2T(floor(n/2)) + n for n > 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We guess that the solution is T(n) = O(n log n). So we must prove that T(n) <= cn log n for some constant c. (We will get to n0 later, but for now let's try to prove the statement for all n >= 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As our inductive hypothesis, we assume T(n) <= cn log n for all positive numbers less than n. Therefore, T(floor(n/2)) <= c floor(n/2) log (floor(n/2)), and\n",

    "         \n",
    "Now we need to show the base case. This is tricky, because if T(n) <= cn log n, then T(1) <= 0, which is not a thing. So we revise our induction so that we only prove the statement for n >= 2, and the base cases of the induction proof (which is not the same as the base case of the recurrence!) are n = 2 and n = 3. (We are allowed to do this because asymptotic notation only requires us to prove our statement for n >= n0, and we can set n0 = 2).\n",

    "So proving the inductive step as above, plus proving the bound works for n = 2 and n = 3, suffices for our proof that the bound works for all n > 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging the numbers into the recurrence formula, we get T(2) = 2T(1) + 2 = 4 and T(3) = 2T(1) + 3 = 5. So now we just need to choose a _c_ that satisfies those constraints on T(2) and T(3). We can choose c = 2, because 4 <= 2 * 2 log 2 and 5 <= 2 * 3 log 3.\n",

    "#### 1.1.2 Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning:__ Using the substitution method, it is easy to prove a weaker bound than the one you're supposed to prove. For instance, if the runtime is O(n), you might still be able to substitue cn^2 into the recurrence and prove that the bound is O(n^2). Which is technically true, but don't let it mislead you into thinking it's the best bound on the runtime. People often get burned by this on exams!\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning:__ You must prove the exact form of the inductive hypothesis. For example, in the recurrence T(n) = 2T(floor(n/2)) + n, we could falsly \"prove\" T(n) = O(n) by guessing T(n) <= cn and then arguing T(n) <= 2(c floor(n/2)) + n <= cn + n = O(n). Here we needed to prove T(n) <= cn, not T(n) <= (c+1)n. Accumulated over many recursive calls, those \"plus ones\" add up."
