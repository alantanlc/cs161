    "### Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort is an algorithm for sorting arrays. The following figure shows how insertion sort works. The whole time, you have a \"sorted\" part of the array (on the left) and an \"unsorted\" part of the array (on the right). In the beginning, the entire array is unsorted, and the sorted part of the array is just the first element in the array. On each iteration of the outer loop, you extend the sorted part by one element, and move that element to the correct position in the sorted part of the array. Eventually all of the numbers end up in the sorted part and the array is sorted."

    "\n",
    "In order to meaningfully analyze algorithms, we first need to formalize exactly how they work. When doing this we abstract away implementation details that are specific to a particular computer architecture, or a particular programming language. Instead, we make mathematical assumptions about the behavious of computers and base all our analyses on these assumptions. As a result, analyzing algorithms become more about proving theorems than actual programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we assum that it takes constant time to access any element in an array. This is not necessarily true in practice, since computers have caches, and the time required to access an element on a real computer depends on which previous elements have been accessed. However, the constant time assumption is mathematically convenient for our purposes.\n",

It's so important than often we find ourselves writing proofs that the algorithms are correct. Many of the standard proof techniques apply here, such as proof by contradiction and proof by induction.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Initialization:__ The loop invariant is satisfied at the beginning of the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Maintenance:__ If the loop invariant is true before the _i_-th iteration, then the loop invariant will be true before the _i_ + 1st iteration.\n",

    "__Termination:__ When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.\n",

    "In the case of insertion sort, we have:\n",

    "__Initialization:__ Before the first iteration (which is when _j_ = 2), the subarray [1..j-1] is just the first element of the array, A[1]. This subarray is sorted, and consists of the elements that were originally in A[1..1].\n",
    "\n",
    "__Maintenance:__ Suppose A[1..j-1] is sorted. Informally, the body of the loop works by moving A[j-1], A[j-2], A[j-3] and so on by one position to the right until it finds the proper position for A[j] (lines 4-7), at which point it inserts the value of A[j] (line 8). The subarray A[1..j] then consists of the elements originally in A[1..j], but in sorted order. Incrementing _j_ for the next iteration of the for loop then preserves the loop invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Termination:__ The condition causing the for loop to terminate is that _j_ > _n_. Because each loop iteration increases _j_ by 1, we must have _j_ = _n_ + 1 at that time. By the initialization and maintenance steps, we have shown that the subarray A[1..n + 1 - 1] consists of the elements originally in A[1..n], but in sorted order."
